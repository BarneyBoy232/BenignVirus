Here are the answers to your questions regarding window management:

Does it need administrator permission? No. Simply removing the window decorations (minimize, maximize, close buttons, and title bar) is a standard feature of the operating system's window manager. Any user-level application can do this without elevated privileges.

What are the commands to replicate this? In the context of the PySide6 (Qt) library you are using, the command is setWindowFlags.

To remove the title bar and buttons: Qt.FramelessWindowHint

To keep it above other windows: Qt.WindowStaysOnTopHint

To hide it from the taskbar (optional): Qt.Tool or Qt.SubWindow

Usage: self.setWindowFlags(Qt.FramelessWindowHint | Qt.WindowStaysOnTopHint)

Can I use it to cover the whole screen and block closing? Yes, physically, but with security caveats:

Visuals: You can set the window geometry to match the screen resolution (or use showFullScreen()) with the FramelessWindowHint. This will visually cover everything, including the taskbar.

Input Trapping: Because the window is fullscreen and "on top," mouse clicks won't reach the desktop.

Escaping: Smart users can still escape.

Alt+Tab / Windows Key: You need to aggressively hook the keyboard (which your keyboard module already does) to suppress these keys.

Ctrl+Alt+Del: You cannot block this on Windows without replacing the OS shell or writing a custom driver. It is a kernel-level safety feature. A user can always use this to open Task Manager and kill your process.
