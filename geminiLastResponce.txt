Connecting to PCs Over the Internet

To control your 50+ PCs when you are not on the same Wi-Fi, you need a way to bypass the router's firewall. Here are the three most effective methods.

1. RustDesk (Easiest - "Zero Config")

RustDesk is designed to work over the internet out of the box.

How it works: Each PC gets a unique "ID" (like a phone number). You enter that ID on your Main PC, and RustDesk's public servers connect the two computers regardless of where they are in the world.

Setup: In your All_In_One_Install.bat, the command to set the password ensures that as long as the PC has internet, you can log in using its ID and your Control123! password.

2. Tailscale (The "Global Wi-Fi")

Tailscale creates a Virtual Private Network (VPN). It makes all 50 PCs act as if they are sitting in the same room on the same Wi-Fi, even if they are in different cities.

How it works: You install Tailscale on every PC. Each PC gets a "Tailscale IP" (e.g., 100.x.x.x).

Benefit: You can keep using your deploy_to_network.ps1 script exactly as it is, just replace the Wi-Fi IPs with the Tailscale IPs.

Cost: Free for up to 100 devices (perfect for your 50-PC project).

3. Action1 (Cloud-Based Management)

As mentioned in your remote_management_guide.md, Action1 is the professional choice for internet-only management.

How it works: The "Agent" you install on the PCs "phones home" to the Action1 website.

Benefit: You don't need to run scripts from your Main PC anymore. You just log into the Action1 website from any browser and click "Install" or "Remote Desktop."

Security Warning

Never use "Port Forwarding" (opening port 3389) on your router to allow Microsoft Remote Desktop over the internet. This is extremely dangerous and will lead to your PCs being hacked or hit with ransomware within minutes. Always use a tool like RustDesk, Tailscale, or Action1.




Remote PC Management & Auto-Installation Guide

To manage 5 PCs from one main station over Wi-Fi, you should use a combination of Remote Control (for visual access) and Package Management (for fast, automated installs).

1. The "Visual" Way: Remote Desktop (To see the screens)

If you want to access the actual screen of the other PCs so you don't have to walk over to them, use one of these:

Microsoft Remote Desktop (Built-in): * Pros: Fast, no extra software needed on the main PC.

Cons: Only works if the 5 PCs have Windows Pro or Enterprise. Windows Home cannot be "remoted into" using this method.

RustDesk or AnyDesk (Free/Open Source):

Pros: Works on all Windows versions (Home & Pro). Very easy to set up.

Setup: Install the app on all 5 PCs, set a "Password for Unattended Access," and you can jump into any screen instantly from your main PC.

2. The "Auto-Install" Way: Chocolatey + SSH

If you want to install Chrome, VLC, Zoom, etc., on all 5 PCs at once without clicking "Next" on every screen, use a Package Manager.

Step A: Install Chocolatey on the 5 PCs

On each of the 5 computers, run PowerShell as Administrator and paste this:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('[https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1](https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1)'))


Step B: Install Software Remotely

Once Chocolatey is installed, you can use a tool like PsExec (from Microsoft Sysinternals) to send commands from your main PC to the others.

Example Command (from your Main PC):
To install Google Chrome on a PC with the IP 192.168.1.50:

psexec \\192.168.1.50 -u [Username] -p [Password] choco install googlechrome -y


-y means "Yes to all," so it installs silently in the background.

3. The "All-in-One" Tool: Action1 (Recommended)

For exactly 5 PCs, I recommend using Action1. It is a cloud-based tool that is free for the first 100 PCs.

Install the Agent: You install a tiny piece of software on the 5 PCs.

Web Dashboard: You log into the Action1 website from your main PC.

Deploy: You can see all 5 PCs in a list, select them all, and click "Install App." It will download and install the software on all of them simultaneously while you sit at your desk.

Summary Recommendation

For quick screen access: Use RustDesk.

For bulk installing apps: Use Action1 (it's the easiest "set it and forget it" solution for small networks).
