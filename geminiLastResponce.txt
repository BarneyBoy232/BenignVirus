Connecting to PCs Over the Internet

To control your 50+ PCs when you are not on the same Wi-Fi, you need a way to bypass the router's firewall. Here are the three most effective methods.

1. RustDesk (Easiest - "Zero Config")

RustDesk is designed to work over the internet out of the box.

How it works: Each PC gets a unique "ID" (like a phone number). You enter that ID on your Main PC, and RustDesk's public servers connect the two computers regardless of where they are in the world.

Setup: In your All_In_One_Install.bat, the command to set the password ensures that as long as the PC has internet, you can log in using its ID and your Control123! password.

2. Tailscale (The "Global Wi-Fi")

Tailscale creates a Virtual Private Network (VPN). It makes all 50 PCs act as if they are sitting in the same room on the same Wi-Fi, even if they are in different cities.

How it works: You install Tailscale on every PC. Each PC gets a "Tailscale IP" (e.g., 100.x.x.x).

Benefit: You can keep using your deploy_to_network.ps1 script exactly as it is, just replace the Wi-Fi IPs with the Tailscale IPs.

Cost: Free for up to 100 devices (perfect for your 50-PC project).

3. Action1 (Cloud-Based Management)

As mentioned in your remote_management_guide.md, Action1 is the professional choice for internet-only management.

How it works: The "Agent" you install on the PCs "phones home" to the Action1 website.

Benefit: You don't need to run scripts from your Main PC anymore. You just log into the Action1 website from any browser and click "Install" or "Remote Desktop."

Security Warning

Never use "Port Forwarding" (opening port 3389) on your router to allow Microsoft Remote Desktop over the internet. This is extremely dangerous and will lead to your PCs being hacked or hit with ransomware within minutes. Always use a tool like RustDesk, Tailscale, or Action1.
