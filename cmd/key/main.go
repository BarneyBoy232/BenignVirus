// Command projectBV-key is the installer ("the key"). Double-clicking it installs
// the agent onto this device; the fleet can also run it on itself to UPDATE the
// agent, with nobody at the machine. It picks the right install automatically:
//
//   - Admin available  -> machine-wide install: a Windows service that runs
//     before login for every user, in Program Files, listed in Programs & Features.
//   - Standard user    -> per-user install (NO admin, NO UAC): agent in the user's
//     AppData, auto-started at that user's login via the Run key.
//
// If the agent is already installed, this replaces it in place: the running copy
// is stopped, the binary is swapped in one move, started again, and only believed
// once it has stayed up AND checked in with the fleet. Anything short of that puts
// the previous agent back — by copying it into place, or failing that by pointing
// the service straight at the backup — so a device keeps an agent it can be
// reached through.
//
// It runs silently (no window). Progress is written to the agent log.
//
// Flags (used when the fleet updates itself; irrelevant when double-clicked):
//
//	--record-version <v>  record this version as installed, so the agent's own
//	                      update check doesn't install it all over again
//	--no-prompt           never ask for elevation; install per-user instead
//	--detached            internal: set on the copy that does the real work
